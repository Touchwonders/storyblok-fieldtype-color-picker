# Examples

There are 2 different config set-ups we provide in this current iteration.

## Simple
Comes down to simply adding hex codes (preferably 6 chars) to the options section of the block where the plugin lives. The option names do not matter here as well.

## Layered
Under the hood we make use of the [vue swatches](https://saintplay.github.io/vue-swatches/) plugin, where having nested colors is possible as well. This makes sense if you want to show, for example, several palettes. The option names _**do matter**_ in this case, make sure everything before the first dash is the same exact string value.
